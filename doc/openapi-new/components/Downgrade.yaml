                - `automatic`: Downgrade will occur automatically when the conditions for being at a given tier are not met.
                - `periodic`: Downgrade will occur periodically. If this mode is selected, you must also choose a `period`.

                - `registration_anniversary`: Downgrade occurs annually on the anniversary of your registration date. For example,  if you registered on 2020-10-10, the next downgrade will take place on 2025-10-10, followed by 2026-10-10, and so on.
                - `annual_recalculation_on_chosen_dates`: Allows you to specify a list of dates on which the downgrade will occur every year. For instance, if you add 03-10 and 07-15, downgrades will happen annually on March 10 and July 15.
                - `recalculation_every_month_after_tier_promotion`: Enables you to set a specific interval (in months) after the last tier promotion for the downgrade to occur. For example,  if your promotion date is 2025-10-10 and the interval is set to 2 months, your downgrade date will be 2025-12-10.
